# Transformer Differential Relay (TDR) Dataset: Faults and FDIAs

This repository provides a comprehensive dataset of three-phase current measurements collected by a **Transformer Differential Relay (TDR)** under both **legitimate electrical faults** and **false data injection attacks (FDIAs)**.

## 📁 Dataset Structure

The dataset contains **53,490** multivariate time-series samples, organized into six subfolders:

- `one_phase_to_ground_faults/`
- `two_phase_to_ground_faults/`
- `three_phase_to_ground_faults/`
- `one_phase_to_ground_attacks/`
- `two_phase_to_ground_attacks/`
- `three_phase_to_ground_attacks/`

Each subfolder corresponds to a specific fault type or FDIA scenario. Each file represents a single event recorded by the TDR.

## 📊 Data Format

- **Channels**: 6 (Three-phase currents from both sides of the transformer)
- **Sampling Rate**: 4800 samples/second  
- **Window Duration**: 20 milliseconds (96 time steps per channel)
- **Time Alignment**: Window begins ~10 ms before the fault or attack event
- **Format**: .pkl files, each of shape `(6, 96)` — 6 channels × 96 time steps

## ⚡ Event Types

### ✅ Legitimate Fault Scenarios
Simulated fault conditions to represent realistic power system events:
- Single-phase (1Φ), two-phase (2Φ), and three-phase (3Φ) faults
- Varying inception angles, durations, and locations

### 🚨 FDIA Scenarios
Simulated cyberattacks aiming to deceive the relay into misclassifying an attack as a fault:
- **Magnitude Manipulation**
- **Phase Angle Manipulation**
- **Time-Synchronization Attacks**
- Targeting 1, 2, or all 3 phases with randomized start times and durations
